# chapter 10 pursue

PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide (5th Edition) Written by Larry Ullman

Complete the following from the chapter's Pursue section:

Create scripts that interact with the banking database to delete and edit customer accounts. Youâ€™ll have to factor in the foreign key constraints in place, which limit, for example, the deletion of customers that still have accounts. 

Create a set of test cases that will validate the scripts including foreign key constraints.
Create the scripts.
Demonstrate that your scripts work by using the test cases, and running queries that show the contents of the database after each change or deletion.
Document all of this with screenshots.
Submission: Submit a .zip file which contains screenshots, your test cases, and your working code.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
